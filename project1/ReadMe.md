#Project Objective  
Utilize what you have learned in class plus any other relevant knowledge
to write a program that plays against a human player (e.g., you) in a twoplayer board game − CANTRIS (Candy Crush + Tetris).  

#Rule  
2-1. When it is your turn, you can either remove only one tile or take
two tiles off the board sequentially, detailed in (3) below. The number
of the selected tile is then added to your points.  

2-2. All the tiles on the same column above the one you remove will
drop by one position after the removal, e.g., after the tile 3 is removed,
both the tiles 2 and 1 above it will drop by one position to fill the
vacancy. Your total points are now 3.   

2-3. After the tiles fall to their lawful positions, in case of three or more
adjacent tiles with the same number on the same row will be further
removed from the board, and the sum of the numbers of the tiles is
added to the points. The steps 2-2 and 2-3 are repeated if applicable
until no more tile can be removed. After that, the game switches to
Computer’s turn, and all the rules above apply in the same way.
